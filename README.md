# A Task API Manager to learn Node.js 

This API is part of [Andrew Mead's course on Node.js](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/). The source code is full of my comments and explanations (in Spanish) that help me to understand its architecture and workflow. 

Throughout the development of this App, I was able to use and implement the following technologies:

- Node.js with [Express](https://expressjs.com) and [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com) for modelling data
- NPM packages and services such as [JWT](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken), [Bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt), [Multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer), [Sharp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sharp) and [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com)
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com) to make HTTP requests (authentication via token, forms) and set up environments for development and production
- [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com) to deploy the API
- [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) and [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass) and [Robo 3T](https://robomongo.org) as MongoDB GUIs
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io) as a testing framework
- Other techniques such as the creation of environment variables to preserve the security of the source code
